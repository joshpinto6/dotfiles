# ⚙️ My Dotfiles

Everything I use to develop projects that could be considered either, _a) 🗑️ junk_ or _b) ✨ beautifully-crafted experiences valuing simplicity and openness,_ depending on your perspective.

This config mostly focuses on providing the tools I use to:
- Develop full-stack web applications (React, Svelte, Node) with tools such as Prettier and ESLint
- Develop mobile apps using flutter (config for this is still WIP)
- Develop this very config (with Lua)

## Config Overview(s)

### ⌨️ Neovim

A fairly minimal kickstart.nvim configuration with added flair. A cozy 📦 Gruvbox theme with a 😺 snazzy tabby-based navigation bar, 💥 stylish noice notifications, 💽 streamlined Neogit VCS control, and a ⏲️ customized lualine with wakatime. 

### 🌀 WezTerm

Focused on compatibility with the neovim theme, terminal emulation features a 🗓️ statusbar, 💻 compatibility with device UI mode, 🌫️ transparent terminal, and 💾 support for persistent, workspace-based multiplexing.
