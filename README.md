# ⚙️ My Dotfils

Everything I use to develop projects that could be subjectively viewed as either a) 🗑️ juk or b) ✨ beautifully-crafted experiences valuing simplicity and openness. 

## 📖 Table of Contents

- Neovim (Text Editor) Config
- Wezterm (Terminal Emulator) Config

## Config Overview(s)

### ⌨️ Neovim

A fairly minimal kickstart.nvim configuration with added flair. A cozy Gruvbox theme with a snazzy tabby-based navigation bar, stylish noice notifications, streamlined Neogit VCS control, and a customized lualine with wakatime. 

### 🌀 WezTerm

Focused on compatibility with the neovim theme, terminal emulation features a statusbar, compatibility with device UI mode, transparent terminal, and support for persistent, workspace-based multiplexing.
