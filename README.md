# ⚙️ My Dotfiles

Everything I use to develop projects that could be subjectively viewed as either a) 🗑️ jnk or b) ✨ beautifully-crafted experiences valuing simplicity and openness. 

## 📖 Table of Contents

- Neovim (Text Editor) Config
- Wezterm (Terminal Emulator) Config

## Config Overview(s)

### ⌨️ Neovim

A fairly minimal kickstart.nvim configuration with added flair. A cozy 📦 Gruvbox theme with a 😺 snazzy tabby-based navigation bar, 💥 stylish noice notifications, 💽 streamlined Neogit VCS control, and a ⏲️ customized lualine with wakatime. 

### 🌀 WezTerm

Focused on compatibility with the neovim theme, ⌚ terminal emulation features a statusbar, 💻 compatibility with device UI mode, 🌫️ transparent terminal, and 💾 support for persistent, workspace-based multiplexing.
